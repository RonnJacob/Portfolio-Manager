/**
 * The following interface represents a stock of a company and operations pertaining to the stock of
 * a company.In its simplest form, a stock of a company is simply a part of ownership in that
 * company. Ownership is divided into shares, where a share represents a fraction of the total
 * ownership. For example, Apple has about 5.2B shares. So if you own 100 shares, you own about
 * 1.9ùë•10‚àí6 1.9 x 10 ‚àí 6 % of the company (and it would be worth about $20800 today). Anyone who
 * holds a share is considered a shareholder and is an investor. An investor sends money to the
 * company to buy some of its stock, and gets part ownership in return. The total money invested in
 * the stock (money spent buying it) is called the cost basis of the purchase. The value of the
 * stock on a particular day is the money the investor would receive if he/she sold the stock on
 * that day. When the company performs well (e.g. it makes a profit, it expands its business, does
 * business with more money, etc.) the price of the stock goes up because its value in the stock
 * market increases (everybody wants to own that stock). When an investor sells stocks whose prices
 * have risen above their cost bases, they make a profit (they get more money than they had paid to
 * buy the stock earlier). The interface provides methods to retrieve the total cost basis of a
 * stock up until a particular date which would retrieve the cost basis of shares that have been
 * bought up until a particular date. Similarly the stock value can be retrieved for a stock of a
 * company up until a particular date and would be returned. It is mandatory that the date is of
 * string format yyyy-mm-dd. An IllegalArgumentException would be thrown in any case that the date
 * is of invalid format or a date for which stock data cannot be added. Exceptions would also be
 * thrown while adding share if the amount to buy shares is negative.
